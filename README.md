  [Databricks on AWS documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/index.html).
  Use the cloud switcher menu located in the upper right hand corner of the
  documentation to select corresponding documentation for a different cloud.
* [On-host deployment](#on-host) is currently the only supported deployment
  type. For Databricks and non-Databricks Spark deployments, the integration can
  be deployed on [any supported host platform](#deploy-the-integration-on-a-host).
  For Databricks, support is also provided to deploy the integration
  on the [driver node of a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster)
  using a [cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html).

## Getting Started

To get started with the New Relic Databricks integration,
[deploy the integration](#on-host) using a supported deployment type,
[configure](#configuration) the integration using supported configuration
mechanisms, and then [import](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#import-json)
the [sample dashboard](./examples/spark-dashboard.json).

### On-host

The New Relic Databricks integration can be run on any supported host platform.
The integration will collect Databricks telemetry (including Spark on
Databricks) via the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
using the [Databricks SDK for Go](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-go.html)
and/or Spark telemetry from a non-Databricks Spark deployment via the
[Spark ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/monitoring.html#rest-api).

The New Relic Databricks integration can also be deployed on the driver node of
a Databricks [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
using the provided [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) to install
and configure the integration at cluster startup time.

#### Deploy the integration on a host

The New Relic Databricks integration provides binaries for the following
host platforms.

* Linux amd64
* Windows amd64

To run the Databricks integration on a host, perform the following steps.

1. Download the appropriate archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-databricks-integration/releases).
1. Extract the archive to a new or existing directory.
1. Create a directory named `configs` in the same directory.
1. Create a file named `config.yml` in the `configs` directory and copy the
   contents of the file [`configs/config.template.yml`](./configs/config.template.yml)
   in this repository into it.
1. Edit the `config.yml` file to [configure](#configuration) the integration
   appropriately for your environment.
1. From the directory where the archive was extracted, execute the integration
   binary using the command `./newrelic-databricks-integration` (or
   `.\newrelic-databricks-integration.exe` on Windows) with the appropriate
   [Command Line Options](#command-line-options).

#### Deploy the integration on the driver node of a Databricks cluster

The New Relic Databricks integration can be deployed on the driver node of a
Databricks [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
using a [cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html).
The [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) uses custom
[environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#env-var)
to specify configuration parameters necessary for the integration [configuration](#configuration).

To install the [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh), perform the
following steps.

1. Login to your Databricks account and navigate to the desired
   [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
1. Follow the [recommendations for init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/index.html#recommendations-for-init-scripts)
   to store the [`cluster_init_integration.sh`](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh)
   script within your workspace in the recommended manner. For example, if your
   workspace is [enabled for Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#step-1-confirm-that-your-workspace-is-enabled-for-unity-catalog),
   you should store the init script in a [Unity Catalog volume](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/file-upload/upload-to-volume.html).
1. Navigate to the [`Compute`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#view-compute)
   tab and select the desired all-purpose or job compute to open the compute
   details UI.
1. Click the button labeled `Edit` to [edit the compute's configuration](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#edit-a-compute).
1. Follow the steps to [use the UI to configure a cluster-scoped init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html#configure-a-cluster-scoped-init-script-using-the-ui)
   and point to the location where you stored the init script in step 2 above.
1. If your cluster is not running, click on the button labeled `Confirm` to
   save your changes. Then, restart the cluster. If your cluster is already
   running, click on the button labeled `Confirm and restart` to save your
   changes and restart the cluster.

Additionally, follow the steps to [set environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#environment-variables)
to add the following environment variables.

module used by the integration. Additionally, note that only the personal access
token _or_ OAuth credentials need to be specified but not both. If both are
specified, the OAuth credentials take precedence. Finally, make sure to restart
the cluster following the configuration of the environment variables.

## Features

The New Relic Databricks integration supports the following capabilities.

* Collect Spark telemetry

  The New Relic Databricks integration can collect telemetry from Spark running
  on Databricks. By default, the integration will automatically connect to
  and collect telemetry from the Spark deployments in all clusters created via
  the UI or API in the specified workspace.

  The New Relic Databricks integration can also collect Spark telemetry from any
  non-Databricks Spark deployment.

* Collect Databricks consumption and cost data

  The New Relic Databricks integration can collect consumption and cost related
  data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
  This data can be used to show Databricks DBU consumption metrics and estimated
  Databricks costs directly within New Relic.

* Collect Databricks job run telemetry

  The New Relic Databricks integration can collect telemetry about
  [Databricks Job](https://docs.databricks.com/en/jobs/index.html#what-are-databricks-jobs)
  runs, such as job run durations, task run durations, the current state of job
  and task runs, if a job or a task is a retry, and the number of times a task
  was retried.

* Collect Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs

  The New Relic Databricks integration can collect [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
  for all [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
  defined in a [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
  [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
  entries for every [pipeline update](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html)
  are collected and sent to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).

the Databricks collector settings related to the collection of [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
telemetry.

##### Databricks `spark` configuration

###### Databricks Spark `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of Spark metrics | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect Spark telemetry from Spark running on Databricks.

This flag can be used to disable the collection of Spark telemetry by the
Databricks collector. This may be useful to control data ingest when business
requirements call for the collection of non-Spark related Databricks telemetry
and Spark telemetry is not used. This flag is also used by the integration when
it is [deployed directly on the driver node of a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster) using the
the provided [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh) since Spark
telemetry is collected by the Spark collector in this scenario.

**NOTE:** This configuration parameter replaces the older [`sparkMetrics`](#sparkmetrics)
configuration parameter.

###### Databricks Spark `metricPrefix`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A prefix to prepend to Spark metric names | string | N | N/a |

This parameter serves the same purpose as the [`metricPrefix`](#metricprefix)
parameter of the [Spark configuration](#spark-configuration) except that it
applies to Spark telemetry collected by the Databricks collector. See the
[`metricPrefix`](#metricprefix) parameter of the [Spark configuration](#spark-configuration)
for more details.

Note that this parameter has no effect on Spark telemetry collected by the Spark
collector. This includes the case when the integration is
[deployed directly on the driver node of a Databricks cluster](#deploy-the-integration-on-the-driver-node-of-a-databricks-cluster)
using the the provided [init script](./init/cluster_init_integration.sh)
since Spark telemetry is collected by the Spark collector in this scenario.

**NOTE:** This configuration parameter replaces the older [`sparkMetricPrefix`](#sparkmetricprefix)
configuration parameter.

###### Databricks Spark `clusterSources`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The root node for the [Databricks cluster source configuration](#databricks-cluster-source-configuration) | YAML Mapping | N | N/a |

The mechanism used to create a cluster is referred to as a cluster "source". The
Databricks collector supports collecting Spark telemetry from all-purpose
clusters created via the UI or API and from job clusters created via the
Databricks Jobs Scheduler. This element groups together the flags used to
individually [enable or disable](#databricks-cluster-source-configuration) the
cluster sources from which the Databricks collector will collect Spark
telemetry.

**NOTE:** This configuration parameter replaces the older [`sparkClusterSources`](#sparkclustersources)
configuration parameter.

##### Databricks cluster source configuration

###### `ui`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of Spark telemetry from all-purpose clusters created via the UI | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect Spark telemetry from all all-purpose clusters created via the UI.

This flag can be used to disable the collection of Spark telemetry from
all-purpose clusters created via the UI.

###### `job`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of Spark telemetry from job clusters created via the Databricks Jobs Scheduler | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect Spark telemetry from job clusters created by the Databricks Jobs
Scheduler.

This flag can be used to disable the collection of Spark telemetry from job
clusters created via the Databricks Jobs Scheduler.

###### `api`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of Spark telemetry from all-purpose clusters created via the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction) | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect Spark telemetry from all-purpose clusters created via the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of Spark telemetry from
all-purpose clusters created via the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).

##### Databricks Usage Configuration

The Databricks usage configuration parameters are used to configure Databricks
collector settings related to the collection of Databricks
[consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data).

###### Databricks Usage `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of consumption and cost data | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of consumption and cost data by
the Databricks collector. This may be useful when running multiple instances of
the New Relic Databricks integration. In this scenario, Databricks consumption
and cost data collection should _only_ be enabled on a single instance.
Otherwise, this data will be recorded more than once in New Relic, affecting
consumption and cost calculations.

###### `warehouseId`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ID of a SQL warehouse on which to run usage-related SQL statements | string | Y | N/a |

The ID of a SQL warehouse on which to run the SQL statements used to collect
Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data).

This parameter is required when the collection of Databricks
[consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data) is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled).

###### `includeIdentityMetadata`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable inclusion of identity related metadata in consumption and cost data | `true` / `false` | N | `false` |

When the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector can include
several pieces of identifying information along with the consumption and cost
data.

By default, when the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector will _not_
collect such data as it may be personally identifiable. This flag can be used to
enable the inclusion of the identifying information.

When enabled, the following values are included.

* The identity of the user a serverless billing record is attributed to. This
  value is included in the [identity metadata](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html#analyze-identity-metadata)
  returned from usage records in the [billable usage system table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html).
* The identity of the cluster creator for each usage record for billable usage
  attributed to all-purpose and job compute.
* The single user name for each usage record for billable usage attributed to
  all-purpose and job compute configured for [single-user access mode](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#access-mode).
* The identity of the warehouse creator for each usage record for billable usage
  attributed to SQL warehouse compute.
* The identity of the user or service principal used to run jobs for each query
  result collected by [job cost data](#job-costs) queries.

###### `runTime`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time of day (as `HH:mm:ss`) at which to run usage data collection | string with format `HH:mm:ss` | N | `02:00:00` |

This parameter specifies the time of day at which the collection of
[consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data) occur. The value must be of
the form `HH:mm:ss` where `HH` is the `0`-padded 24-hour clock hour
(`00` - `23`), `mm` is the `0`-padded minute (`00` - `59`) and `ss` is the
`0`-padded second (`00` - `59`). For example, `09:00:00` is the time 9:00 AM and
`23:30:00` is the time 11:30 PM.

The time will _always_ be interpreted according to the UTC time zone. The time
zone can not be configured. For example, to specify that the integration should
be run at 2:00 AM EST (-0500), the value `07:00:00` should be specified.

###### `optionalQueries`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The root node for the set of flags used to selectively enable or disable optional usage queries | YAML Mapping | N | N/a |

When the collection of Databricks [consumption and cost data](#consumption--cost-data)
is [enabled](#databricks-usage-enabled), the Databricks collector will always
collect [billable usage data](#billable-usage-data) and [list pricing data](#list-pricing-data)
on every run. In addition, by default, the Databricks collector will also run
all [job cost](#job-costs) queries on every run. However, the latter behavior
can be configured using a set of flags specified with this configuration
property to selectively enable or disable the [job cost](#job-costs) queries.
Each flag is specified using a property with the query ID as the name of the
property and `true` or `false` as the value of the property.The following flags
are supported.

* [`jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job_run`](#list-cost-per-job-run)
* [`jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job`](#list-cost-per-job)
* [`jobs_cost_frequent_failures`](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures)
* [`jobs_cost_most_retries`](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs)

For example, to enable the [list cost per job run](#list-cost-per-job-run) query
and the [list cost per job](#list-cost-per-job) query but disable the
[list cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures) query
and the [list cost of repaired job runs for jobs with frequent repairs](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs) query,
the following configuration would be specified.

```yaml
  optionalQueries:
    jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job_run: true
    jobs_cost_list_cost_per_job: true
    jobs_cost_frequent_failures: false
    jobs_cost_most_retries: false
```

##### Databricks Job configuration

###### `runs`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The root node for the set of [Databricks Job Run configuration](#databricks-job-run-configuration) parameters | YAML Mapping | N | N/a |

This element groups together the configuration parameters to [configure](#databricks-job-run-configuration)
the Databricks collector settings related to the collection of [job run data](#job-run-data).

##### Databricks job run configuration

The Databricks job run configuration parameters are used to configure Databricks
collector settings related to the collection of Databricks [job run data](#job-run-data).

###### Databricks job runs `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of job run data | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect [job run data](#job-run-data).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of job run data by the
Databricks collector. This may be useful when running multiple instances of the
New Relic Databricks integration against the same Databricks
[workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
In this scenario, Databricks job run data collection should _only_ be enabled on
a single instance of the integration. Otherwise, this data will be recorded more
than once in New Relic, affecting product features that use [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics)
(e.g. [dashboards](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/)
and [alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/overview/)).

###### Databricks job run `metricPrefix`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A prefix to prepend to Databricks [job run metric](#job-run-metrics) names | string | N | N/a |

This parameter specifies a prefix that will be prepended to each Databricks
[job run metric](#job-run-metrics) name when the metric is exported to New
Relic.

For example, if this parameter is set to `databricks.`, then the full name of
the metric representing the duration of a job run (`job.run.duration`) will be
`databricks.job.run.duration`.

Note that it is not recommended to leave this value empty as the metric names
without a prefix may be ambiguous.

###### Databricks job run `includeRunId`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable inclusion of the job run ID in the `databricksJobRunId` attribute on all [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics) | `true` / `false` | N | `false` |

By default, the Databricks collector will not include job run IDs on any of the
[job run metrics](#job-run-metrics) in order to avoid possible violations of
[metric cardinality limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/convert-to-metrics/creating-metric-rules-requirements-tips/#attributes-limit)
due to the fact that job run IDs have high cardinality because they are unique
across all jobs and job runs.

This flag can be used to enable the inclusion of the job run ID in the
`databricksJobRunId` attribute on all job metrics.

When enabled, use the [Limits UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/#limits-ui)
and/or create a [dashboard](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#create-a-dashboard-to-view-your-limit-status)
in order to monitor your limit status. Additionally, [set alerts on resource metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/#set-alerts-on-resource-metrics)
to provide updates on limits changes.

###### `startOffset`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offset (in seconds) from the current time to use for calculating the earliest job run start time to match when listing job runs | number | N | 86400 (1 day) |

This parameter specifies an offset, in seconds that can be used to tune the
collector's performance by limiting the number of job runs to return by
constraining the start time of job runs to match to be greather than a
particular time in the past calculated as an offset from the current time.

See the section [`startOffset` Configuration](#startoffset-configuration) for
more details.

##### Databricks Pipeline configuration

###### `logs`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The root node for the set of [Databricks Pipeline Event Logs configuration](#databricks-pipeline-event-logs-configuration) parameters | YAML Mapping | N | N/a |

This element groups together the configuration parameters to [configure](#databricks-pipeline-event-logs-configuration)
the Databricks collector settings related to the collection of Databricks Delta
Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs).

##### Databricks pipeline event logs configuration

The Databricks pipeline event logs configuration parameters are used to
configure Databricks collector settings related to the collection of Databricks
Delta Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs).

###### Databricks pipeline event logs `enabled`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flag to enable automatic collection of Databricks Delta Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs) | `true` / `false` | N | `true` |

By default, when the Databricks collector is enabled, it will automatically
collect Databricks Delta Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs).

This flag can be used to disable the collection of Databricks Delta Live Tables
[pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs) by the Databricks collector. This
may be useful when running multiple instances of the New Relic Databricks
integration against the same Databricks [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
In this scenario, the collection of Databricks Delta Live Tables [pipeline event logs](#pipeline-event-logs)
should _only_ be enabled on a single instance of the integration. Otherwise,
duplicate New Relic log entries will be created for each Databricks Delta Live
Tables [pipeline event log](#pipeline-event-logs) entry, making troubleshooting
challenging and affecting product features that rely on signal integrity such as
[anomaly detection](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/anomaly-detection/).

##### Spark configuration

The Spark configuration parameters are used to configure the Spark collector.

###### `webUiUrl`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/web-ui.html) URL of an application on the Spark deployment to monitor | string | N | N/a |

This parameter can be used to monitor a non-Databricks Spark deployment. It
specifes the URL of the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/web-ui.html)
of an application running on the Spark deployment to monitor. The value should
be of the form `http[s]://<hostname>:<port>` where `<hostname>` is the hostname
of the Spark deployment to monitor and `<port>` is the port number of the
Spark application's Web UI (typically 4040 or 4041, 4042, etc if more than one
application is running on the same host).

Note that the value must not contain a path. The path of the [Spark ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.2/monitoring.html#rest-api)
endpoints (mounted at `/api/v1`) will automatically be prepended.

###### `metricPrefix`

| Description | Valid Values | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A prefix to prepend to Spark metric names | string | N | N/a |

This parameter specifies a prefix that will be prepended to each Spark metric
name when the metric is exported to New Relic.

For example, if this parameter is set to `spark.`, then the full name of the
metric representing the value of the memory used on application executors
(`app.executor.memoryUsed`) will be `spark.app.executor.memoryUsed`.

Note that it is not recommended to leave this value empty as the metric names
without a prefix may be ambiguous. Additionally, note that this parameter has no
effect on Spark telemetry collected by the Databricks collector. In that case,
use the [`sparkMetricPrefix`](#sparkmetricprefix) instead.

### Authentication

The Databricks integration uses the [Databricks SDK for Go](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-go.html)
to access the Databricks and Spark ReST APIs. The SDK performs authentication on
behalf of the integration and provides many options for configuring the
authentication type and credentials to be used. See the
[SDK documentation](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication)
and the [Databricks client unified authentication documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/unified-auth.html)
for details.

For convenience purposes, the following parameters can be used in the
[Databricks configuration](#databricks-configuration) section of the
[`config.yml](#configyml) file.

- [`accessToken`](#accesstoken) - When set, the integration will instruct the
  SDK to explicitly use [Databricks personal access token authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html).
  The SDK will _not_ attempt to try other authentication mechanisms and instead
  will fail immediately if personal access token authentication fails.
- [`oauthClientId`](#oauthclientid) - When set, the integration will instruct
  the SDK to explicitly [use a service principal to authenticate with Databricks (OAuth M2M)](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
  The SDK will _not_ attempt to try other authentication mechanisms and instead
  will fail immediately if OAuth M2M authentication fails. The OAuth Client
  secret can be set using the [`oauthClientSecret`](#oauthclientsecret)
  configuration parameter or any of the other mechanisms supported by the SDK
  (e.g. the `client_secret` field in a Databricks [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/config-profiles.html)
  or the `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable).
- [`oauthClientSecret`](#oauthclientsecret) - The OAuth client secret to use for
  [OAuth M2M authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
  This value is _only_ used when [`oauthClientId`](#oauthclientid) is set in the
  [`config.yml`](#configyml). The OAuth client secret can also be set using any
  of the other mechanisms supported by the SDK (e.g. the `client_secret` field
  in a Databricks [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/config-profiles.html)
  or the `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable).

### Apache Spark Data

The New Relic Databricks integration can collect [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html)
[application](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html)
metrics for all running applications in a given [Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/cluster-overview.html).
Metrics are collected by accessing the monitoring [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
through the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html) of a
given [`SparkContext`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/rdd-programming-guide.html#initializing-spark).

This feature can be used for _any_ [Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.4/cluster-overview.html),
not just for Spark running on Databricks. The following logic is used to
determine when application metrics are collected and from what sources.

* When the Databricks collector is enabled (the top-level [`databricks`](#databricks)
  node is specified) and the [Databricks Spark `enabled`](#databricks-spark-enabled)
  flag is not specified or is set to `true`, Spark application metrics are
  collected from the following sources.

  * All _running_ all-purpose [clusters](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
    created through the UI, unless the [`ui`](#ui) [cluster source](#databricks-spark-clustersources)
    flag is set to `false`
  * All _running_ all-purpose [clusters](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
    created through an API request, unless the [`api`](#api) [cluster source](#databricks-spark-clustersources)
    flag is set to `false`
  * All _running_ job [clusters](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster)
    created by the Databricks Job Scheduler, unless the [`job`](#job)
    [cluster source](#databricks-spark-clustersources) flag is set to `false`

* When the Spark collector is enabled (the top-level [`spark`](#spark) node is
  specified), Spark application metrics are collected from the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html)
  URL specified in the [`webUiUrl`](#webuiurl) or from the [Web UI](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html)
  URL `https://localhost:4040` by default.

#### Spark Application Metric Data

Spark application telemetry is sent to New Relic as [dimensional metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).
The provided metrics and attributes (dimensions) are listed in the sections
below.

**NOTE:** Many of the descriptions below are sourced from the
Apache Spark monitoring [ReST API documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api).

##### Spark application metric types

The Apache Spark monitoring [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
returns two types of metrics: monotonically increasing counters (referred to
below simply as "counters") and gauges, with the majority of metrics being
counters.

While all gauge metrics returned from the [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
are created as gauge metrics within New Relic, note that all counter metrics
returned from the [ReST API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api)
are also created as gauge metrics. While the `latest()`, `min()`, `max()`,
`sum()`, `count()`, and `average()` [NRQL aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions)
are all therefore available for use with these metrics, only [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
will provide meaningful results (e.g. taking the average of a set of data points
that represent a monotonically increasing counter makes no sense).

Therefore, in general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting on metrics
listed in the sections below with the metric type `counter`.

Further to this, even when using the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function, the metrics have no meaning without an identifying `FACET`.

As an example, to show the total number of completed tasks by executor ID, use
the query `SELECT latest(app.executor.completedTasks) FROM Metric FACET sparkAppName, sparkAppExecutorId`
and not `SELECT count(app.executor.completedTasks) FROM Metric FACET sparkAppName, sparkAppExecutorId`.
Using `count()` on a gauge metric accesses the `count` field of the metric which
in this case is always `1` even though the metric being represented is a
counter. The counter value is actually in the `latest` field of the metric.
Further, using the metric _without_ faceting by the executor ID will only return
the latest `app.executor.completedTasks` metric in the selected time window and
ignore any other instances of that metric in the same time window.

##### Common Spark application metric attributes

The following attributes are included on _all_ Spark application metrics.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sparkAppId` | string | Spark application ID |
| `sparkAppName` | string | Spark application name |
| `databricksClusterId` | string | **Databricks only** Databricks cluster ID |
| `databricksClusterName` | string | **Databricks only** Databricks cluster name |

##### Spark application metrics

The following metrics are included for each Spark application.

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Description |

| `app.stages` | string | Spark stage [counts](#spark-job-stage-and-task-counts) by stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) |

##### Spark application executor metrics

The following metrics are included for each Spark application executor. Metrics
are scoped to a given executor using the `sparkAppExecutorId` [attribute](#spark-application-executor-attributes).

| Metric Name | Metric Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app.executor.rddBlocks` | gauge | RDD blocks in the block manager of this executor |
| `app.executor.memoryUsed` | gauge | Storage memory used by this executor |
| `app.executor.diskUsed` | gauge | Disk space used for RDD storage by this executor |
| `app.executor.totalCores` | counter | Number of cores available in this executor |
| `app.executor.maxTasks` | counter | Maximum number of tasks that can run concurrently in this executor |
| `app.executor.activeTasks` | gauge | Number of tasks currently executing |
| `app.executor.failedTasks` | counter | Number of tasks that have failed in this executor |

  the `sparkAppStageStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppJobStatus`
  is `running`, it means that the job is running and 2 stages have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppJobId`
  attribute to target a specific job or to group the values by job.

* `app.job.tasks`

  The number of Spark tasks for a Spark job by task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppTaskStatus` and
  `sparkAppJobStatus` attributes, which indicate which task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status)
  and job [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric applies to,
  respectively (for instance, if the metric value is 4 and
  the `sparkAppTaskStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppJobStatus`
  is `running`, it means that the job is running and 4 tasks have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppJobId`
  attribute to target a specific job or to group the values by job.

* `app.stage.tasks`

  The number of Spark tasks for a Spark stage by task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status).
  This metric will always include the `sparkAppTaskStatus` and
  `sparkAppStageStatus` attributes, which indicate which task [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status)
  and stage [status](#spark-job-stage-and-task-status) the metric applies to,
  respectively (for instance, if the metric value is 4 and the
  `sparkAppTaskStatus` attribute is `complete` and the `sparkAppStageStatus`
  is `active`, it means that the stage is running and 4 tasks have completed).

  Use the `sparkAppId` or `sparkAppName` attributes to target a specific
  application or to group the values by application and the `sparkAppStageId` or
  `sparkAppStageName` attribute to target a specific stage or to group the
  values by stage.

In general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting using these
counters.

### Consumption & Cost Data

The New Relic Databricks integration can collect Databricks consumption and cost
related data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
This data can be used to show Databricks DBU consumption metrics and estimated
Databricks costs directly within New Relic.

This feature is enabled by setting the [Databricks usage `enabled`](#databricks-usage-enabled)
flag to `true` in the [integration configuration](#configuration). When enabled,
the Databricks collector will collect consumption and cost related data once a
day at the time specified in the [`runTime`](#runtime) configuration parameter.
The following information is collected on each run.

* Billable usage records from the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html)
* List pricing records from the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html)
* List cost per job run of jobs run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* List cost per job of jobs run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* List cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures run on jobs
  compute and serverless compute
* List cost of repair job runs for jobs with frequent repairs run on jobs
  compute and serverless compute

**NOTE:** Job cost data from jobs run on workspaces outside the region of the
workspace containing the SQL Warehouse used to collect the consumption data
(specified in the [`workspaceHost`](#workspacehost) configuration parameter)
will not be returned by the queries used by the Databricks integration to
collect Job cost data.

#### Consumption and Cost Collection Requirements

In order for the New Relic Databricks integration to collect consumption and
cost related data from Databricks, there are several requirements.

1. The SQL [warehouse ID](#warehouseid) of a [SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/sql-warehouse/index.html)
   within the workspace associated with the configured [workspace host](#workspacehost)
   must be specified. The Databricks SQL queries used to collect consumption and
   cost related data from the Databricks [system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html).
   will be run against the specified SQL warehouse.
1. As of v2.6.0, the Databricks integration leverages data that is stored in the
   `system.lakeflow.jobs` table. As of 10/24/2024, this table is in public
   preview. To access this table, the `lakeflow` schema must be enabled in your
   `system` catalog. To enable the `lakeflow` schema, follow the instructions in
   the Databricks documentation to [enable a system schema](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/index.html#enable-a-system-schema)
   using the metastore ID of the [Unity Catalog metastore](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html#metastores)
   attached to the workspace associated with the configured [workspace host](#workspacehost)
   and the schema name `lakeflow`.

#### Billable Usage Data

On each run, billable usage data is collected from the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html)
_for the previous day_. For each billable usage record, a corresponding record
is created within New Relic as a [New Relic event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data)
with the event type `DatabricksUsage` and the following attributes.

**NOTE:** Not every attribute is included in every event. For example, the
`cluster_*` attributes are only included in events for usage records relevant to
all-purpose or job related compute. Similarly, the `warehouse_*` attributes are
only included in events for usage records relevant to SQL warehouse related
compute.

the job was run within a workspace in the same cloud region as the workspace
containing the SQL warehouse used to collect the consumption data (specified in
the [`workspaceHost`](#workspacehost) configuration parameter).

#### List Pricing Data

On each run, list pricing data is collected from the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html)
and used to populate a [New Relic lookup table](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/lookup-tables-ui/)
named `DatabricksListPrices`. The entire lookup table is updated on each run.
For each pricing record, this table will contain a corresponding row with the
following columns.

**NOTE:** Descriptions below are sourced from the
[pricing system table reference](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html).

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `account_id` | ID of the account this pricing record was generated for |

Note that the `list_price` field contains a single price suitable for simple
long-term estimates. It does not reflect any promotional pricing or custom price
plans.

#### Job Costs

On each run, the Databricks collector runs a set of queries that leverage data
in the [`system.billing.usage` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/billing.html),
the [`system.billing.list_prices` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/pricing.html),
and the [`system.lakeflow.jobs` table](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/system-tables/jobs.html)
to collect job cost related data _for the previous day_. The set of queries that
are run collect the following data.

* [List cost per job run](#list-cost-per-job-run) of jobs run on jobs compute
  and serverless compute
* [List cost per job](#list-cost-per-job) of jobs run on jobs compute and
  serverless compute
* [List cost of failed job runs for jobs with frequent failures](#list-cost-of-failed-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-failures)
  run on jobs compute and serverless compute
* [List cost of repaired job runs for jobs with frequent repairs](#list-cost-of-repaired-job-runs-for-jobs-with-frequent-repairs)
  run on jobs compute and serverless compute

By default, the Databricks integration runs each query on every run. This
behavior can be configured using the [`optionalQueries`](#optionalqueries)
configuration parameter to selectively enable or disable queries by query ID.

For each query that is run, a [New Relic event](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data)
with the event type `DatabricksJobCost` is created for each result row with one
attribute for each column of data. In addition, each event includes a `query_id`
attribute that contains the unique ID of the query that produced the data stored
in the event. This ID can be used in [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)
queries to scope the query to the appropriate data set.

See the following sub-sections for more details on the data sets collected by
each query.

**NOTE:** Please see the note at the end of the [Consumption & Cost Data](#consumption--cost-data)
section regarding job cost data and the last requirement in the
[Consumption and Cost Requirements](#consumption-and-cost-collection-requirements)
section for important considerations for collecting job cost data.

### Job Run Data

The New Relic Databricks integration can collect telemetry about
[Databricks Job](https://docs.databricks.com/en/jobs/index.html#what-are-databricks-jobs)
runs, such as job run durations, task run durations, the current state of job
and task runs, if a job or a task is a retry, and the number of times a task was
retried. This feature is enabled by default and can be enabled or disabled using
the [Databricks jobs `enabled`](#databricks-job-runs-enabled) flag in the
[integration configuration](#configuration).

**NOTE:** Some of the text below is sourced from the
[Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0).

#### `startOffset` Configuration

On each run, the integration uses the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
to retrieve job run data. By default, the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
endpoint for [listing job runs](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
returns a paginated list of _all_ historical job runs sorted in descending order
by start time. On systems with many jobs, there may be a large number of job
runs to retrieve and process, impacting the performance of the collector. To
account for this, the integration provides the [`startOffset`](#startoffset)
configuration parameter. This parameter is used to tune the performance of the
integration by constraining the start time of job runs to match to be greater
than a particular time in the past calculated as an offset from the current time
and thus, limiting the number of job runs to return.

The effect of this behavior is that only job runs which have a start time _at_
or _after_ the calculated start time will be returned on the API call. For
example, using the default [`startOffset`](#startoffset) (86400 seconds or 24
hours), only job runs which started within the last 24 hours will be returned.
This means that jobs that started more than 24 hours ago will not be returned
_even if_ some of those jobs are not yet in a `TERMINATED` [state](#job-and-task-run-states).
Therefore, it is important to carefully select a value for the [`startOffset`](#startoffset)
parameter that will account for long-running job runs without degrading the
performance of the integration.

#### Job Run Metric Data

Job run data is sent to New Relic as [dimensional metrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).
The following metrics and attributes (dimensions) are provided.

##### Job and task run states

Databricks job and task runs can be in one of 6 states.

* `BLOCKED` - run is blocked on an upstream dependency
* `PENDING` - run is waiting to be executed while the cluster and execution
   context are being prepared
* `QUEUED` - run is queued due to concurrency limits
* `RUNNING` - run is executing
* `TERMINATING` - run has completed, and the cluster and execution context are
   being cleaned up
* `TERMINATED` - run has completed

The job and run task states are recorded in the `databricksJobRunState` and
`databricksJobRunTaskState`, respectively. The `databricksJobRunState` is on
every [job run metric](#job-run-metrics) including the task related metrics. The
`databricksJobRunTaskState` is only on [job run metrics](#job-run-metrics)
related to tasks, e.g. `job.run.task.duration`.

##### Job and task run counts

On each run, the integration records the number of job and task runs in each
[state](#job-and-task-run-states) (with the exception of runs in the
`TERMINATED` state (see below)), in the metrics `job.runs` and `job.tasks`,
respectively, using the attributes `databricksJobRunState` and
`databricksJobRunTaskState`, to indicate the [state](#job-and-task-run-states).
In general, only the [`latest()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
aggregator function should be used when visualizing or alerting on counts
including these [states](#job-and-task-run-states). For example, to display the
number of jobs by state, use the following NRQL statement.

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT latest(databricks.job.runs)
FACET databricksJobRunState
```

The count of job and task runs in the `TERMINATED` state are also recorded but
only include job and task runs that have terminated _since the last run_ of the
integration. This is done to avoid counting terminated job and task runs more
than once, making it straightforward to use [aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions)
to visualize or alert on values such as "number of job runs completed per time
period", "average duration of job runs", and "average duration job runs spent in
the queue". For example, to show the average time job runs spend in the queue,
grouped by job name, use the following NRQL statement.

```sql
FROM Metric
SELECT average(databricks.job.run.duration.queue / 1000)
WHERE databricksJobRunState = 'TERMINATED'
FACET databricksJobRunName
LIMIT MAX
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to use the condition `databricksJobRunState = 'TERMINATED'`
or `databricksJobRunTaskState = 'TERMINATED'` when visualizing or alerting on
values using these [aggregator functions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#aggregator-functions).

##### Job and task run durations

The Databricks integration stores job and task run durations in the metrics
`job.run.duration` and `job.run.task.duration`, respectively. The values stored
in these metrics are calculated differently, depending on the state of the job
or task, as follows.

* While a job or task run is running (not `BLOCKED` or `TERMINATED`), the run
  duration stored in the respective metrics is the "wall clock" time of the job
  or task run, calculated as the current time when the metric is collected by
  the integration minus the `start_time` of the job or task run as returned from
  the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction).
  This duration is *inclusive* of any time spent in the queue and any setup
  time, execution time, and cleanup time that has been spent up to the time the
  duration is calculated but does *not* include any time the job or task run was
  blocked.

  This duration is also cumulative, meaning that while the job run is running,
  the value calculated each time the integration runs will include the entire
  "wall clock" time since the reported `start_time`. It is essentially a
  [`cumulativeCount` metric](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/cumulative-metrics/)
  but stored as a `gauge`. Within [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/)
  statements, the [latest()](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#latest)
  function can be used to get the most recent duration. For example, to show the
  most recent duration of job runs that are running grouped by job name, use the
  following NRQL (assuming the job run [metricPrefix](#databricks-job-run-metricprefix)
  is `databricks.`).

  ```sql
  FROM Metric
  SELECT latest(databricks.job.run.duration)
  WHERE databricksJobRunState != 'TERMINATED'
  FACET databricksJobRunName
  ```

* Once a job or task run has been terminated, the run duration stored in the
  respective metrics are not calculated but instead come directly from the
  values returned in the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  (also see the SDK documentation for [`BaseRun`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0/service/jobs#BaseRun)
  and [`RunTask`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@v0.46.0/service/jobs#RunTask)).
  For both job and task runs, the run durations are determined as follows.

  * For job runs of multi-task jobs, the `job.run.duration` for a job run is set
    to the `run_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
    field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).
  * For job runs of single-task jobs, the `job.run.duration` for a job run is
    set to the sum of the `setup_duration`, the `execution_duration` and the
    `cleanup_duration` fields of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
    field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).
  * For task runs, the `job.run.task.duration` for a task run is set to the sum
    of the `setup_duration`, the `execution_duration` and the `cleanup_duration`
    fields of the corresponding task run item in the `tasks` field of the
    corresponding job run item in the `runs` field returned from the
    [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns).

In addition to the `job.run.duration` and `job.run.task.duration` metrics, once
a job or task has terminated, the `job.run.duration.queue` and
`job.run.task.duration.queue` metrics are set to the `queue_duration` field of
the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field returned from the
[`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns) for
job runs, and the `queue_duration` field of the corresponding task run item in
the `tasks` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field from the
[`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns) for
task runs.

Finally, for job runs and task runs of _single-task jobs_, the following metrics
are set.

* The `job.run.duration.setup` and `job.run.task.duration.setup` metrics are set to the
  `setup_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs` field
  returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for job runs, and the `setup_duration` field of the corresponding task run
  item in the `tasks` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
  field from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for task runs.
* The `job.run.duration.execution` and `job.run.task.duration.execution` are set
  to the `execution_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the
  `runs` field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for job runs, and the `execution_duration` field of the corresponding task
  run item in the `tasks` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
  field from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for task runs.
* The `job.run.duration.cleanup` and `job.run.task.duration.cleanup` are set to
  the `cleanup_duration` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
  field returned from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for job runs, and the `cleanup_duration` field of the corresponding task run
  item in the `tasks` field of the corresponding job run item in the `runs`
  field from the [`listruns` API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/listruns)
  for task runs.

### Pipeline Event Logs

The New Relic Databricks integration can collect [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
for all [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/develop-pipelines.html)
defined in a [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
[Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entries for every [pipeline update](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/updates.html)
are collected and sent to [New Relic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management/).

**NOTE:** Some of the text below is sourced from the
[Databricks Delta Live Tables pipeline event log schema documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-schema)
and the [Databricks SDK Go module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go).

#### Pipeline Event Log Data

[Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event logs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
are sent to New Relic as [New Relic Log data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#log-data).
For each [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entry, the [fields from the event log entry](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-schema)
are mapped to attributes on the corresponding New Relic log entry as follows.

**NOTE:** Due to the way in which the [Databricks ReST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/introduction)
returns [Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline event log](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log)
entries (in descending order by timestamp), later event log entries may
sometimes be visible in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/)
before older event log entries are visible. This does not affect the temporal
ordering of the log entries. Once older log entries become visible (usually
30-60s longer than the value of the [`interval` configuration parameter](#interval)),
they are properly ordered by timestamp in the [New Relic Logs UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).

## Building

### Coding Conventions

#### Style Guidelines

While not strictly enforced, the basic preferred editor settings are set in the
[.editorconfig](./.editorconfig). Other than this, no style guidelines are
currently imposed.

#### Static Analysis

This project uses both [`go vet`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet) and
[`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/) to perform static code analysis. These
checks are run via [`precommit`](https://pre-commit.com) on all commits. Though
this can be bypassed on local commit, both tasks are also run during
[the `validate` workflow](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) and must have no
errors in order to be merged.

#### Commit Messages

Commit messages must follow [the conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Again, while this can be bypassed on local commit, it is strictly enforced in
[the `validate` workflow](./.github/workflows/validate.yml).

The basic commit message structure is as follows.

```
<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

In addition to providing consistency, the commit message is used by
[svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) during
[the release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml). The presence and values
of certain elements within the commit message affect auto-versioning. For
example, the `feat` type will bump the minor version. Therefore, it is important
to use the guidelines below and carefully consider the content of the commit
message.

Please use one of the types below.

- `feat` (bumps minor version)
- `fix` (bumps patch version)
- `chore`
- `build`
- `docs`
- `test`

Any type can be followed by the `!` character to indicate a breaking change.
Additionally, any commit that has the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer will
indicate a breaking change.

### Local Development

For local development, simply use `go build` and `go run`. For example,

```bash
go build cmd/databricks/databricks.go
```

Or

```bash
go run cmd/databricks/databricks.go
```

If you prefer, you can also use [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/) with
the `--single-target` option to build the binary for the local `GOOS` and
`GOARCH` only.

```bash
goreleaser build --single-target
```

### Releases

Releases are built and packaged using [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/).
By default, a new release will be built automatically on any push to the `main`
branch. For more details, review the [`.goreleaser.yaml`](./.goreleaser.yaml)
and [the `goreleaser` documentation](https://goreleaser.com/intro/).

The [svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) utility is used to generate the next
tag value [based on commit messages](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu#commit-messages-vs-what-they-do).

### GitHub Workflows

This project utilizes GitHub workflows to perform actions in response to
certain GitHub events.

| Workflow | Events | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| [validate](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) | `push`, `pull_request` to `main` branch | Runs [precommit](https://pre-commit.com) to perform static analysis and runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to validate the last commit message |
| [build](./.github/workflows/build.yml) | `push`, `pull_request` | Builds and tests code |
| [release](./.github/workflows/release.yml) | `push` to `main` branch | Generates a new tag using [svu](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu) and runs [`goreleaser`](https://goreleaser.com/) |
| [repolinter](./.github/workflows/repolinter.yml) | `pull_request` | Enforces repository content guidelines |

## Appendix

The sections below cover topics that are related to Databricks telemetry but
that are not specifically part of this integration. In particular, any assets
referenced in these sections must be installed and/or managed _separately_ from
the integration. For example, the init scripts provided to [monitor cluster health](#monitoring-cluster-health)
are not automatically installed or used by the integration.

### Monitoring Cluster Health

[New Relic Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/)
can be used to collect system metrics like CPU and memory usage from the nodes in
a Databricks [cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#cluster).
Additionally, [New Relic APM](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/)
can be used to collect application metrics like JVM heap size and GC cycle count
from the [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) driver
and executor JVMs. Both are achieved using [cluster-scoped init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html).
The sections below cover the installation of these init scripts.

**NOTE:** Use of one or both init scripts will have a slight impact on cluster
startup time. Therefore, consideration should be given when using the init
scripts with a job cluster, particularly when using a job cluster scoped to a
single task.

#### Configure the New Relic license key

Both the [New Relic Infrastructure Agent init script](#install-the-new-relic-infrastructure-agent-init-script)
and the [New Relic APM Java Agent init script](#install-the-new-relic-apm-java-agent-init-script)
require a [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#overview-keys)
to be specified in a [custom environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#environment-variables)
named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`. While the license key _can_ be specified by
hard-coding it in plain text in the compute configuration, this is not
recommended. Instead, it is recommended to create a [secret](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html).
using the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html)
and [reference the secret in the environment variable](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html#reference-a-secret-in-an-environment-variable).

To create the secret and set the environment variable, perform the following
steps.

1. Follow the steps to [install or update the Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html).
1. Use the Databricks CLI to create a [Databricks-backed secret scope](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secret-scopes.html#create-a-databricks-backed-secret-scope)
   with the name `newrelic`. For example,

   ```bash
   databricks secrets create-scope newrelic
   ```

   **NOTE:** Be sure to take note of the information in the referenced URL about
   the `MANAGE` scope permission and use the correct version of the command.
1. Use the Databricks CLI to create a secret for the license key in the new
   scope with the name `licenseKey`. For example,

   ```bash
   databricks secrets put-secret --json '{
      "scope": "newrelic",
      "key": "licenseKey",
      "string_value": "[YOUR_LICENSE_KEY]"
   }'
   ```

To set the custom environment variable named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and
reference the value from the secret, follow the steps to
[configure custom environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#environment-variables)
and add the following line after the last entry in the `Environment variables`
field.

`NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY={{secrets/newrelic/licenseKey}}`

#### Install the New Relic Infrastructure Agent init script

The [`cluster_init_infra.sh`](./examples/cluster_init_infra.sh) script
automatically installs the latest version of the
[New Relic Infrastructure Agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/)
on each node of the cluster.

To install the init script, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Databricks account and navigate to the desired
   [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
1. Follow [the recommendations for init scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/index.html#recommendations-for-init-scripts)
   to store the [`cluster_init_infra.sh`](./examples/cluster_init_infra.sh)
   script within your workspace in the recommended manner. For example, if your
   workspace is [enabled for Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#step-1-confirm-that-your-workspace-is-enabled-for-unity-catalog),
   you should store the init script in a [Unity Catalog volume](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/file-upload/upload-to-volume.html).
1. Navigate to the [`Compute`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#view-compute)
   tab and select the desired all-purpose or job compute to open the compute
   details UI.
1. Click the button labeled `Edit` to [edit](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#edit-a-compute)
   the compute's configuration.
1. Follow the steps to [use the UI to configure a cluster to run an init script](https://docs.databricks.com/en/init-scripts/cluster-scoped.html#configure-a-cluster-scoped-init-script-using-the-ui)
   and point to the location where you stored the init script in step 2.
1. If your cluster is not running, click on the button labeled `Confirm` to
   save your changes. Then, restart the cluster. If your cluster is already
   running, click on the button labeled `Confirm and restart` to save your
   changes and restart the cluster.

#### Install the New Relic APM Java Agent init script

The [`cluster_init_apm.sh`](./examples/cluster_init_apm.sh) script
automatically installs the latest version of the
[New Relic APM Java Agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java/)
on each node of the cluster.

To install the init script, perform the same steps as outlined in the
[Install the New Relic Infrastructure Agent init script](#install-the-new-relic-infrastructure-agent-init-script)
section using the [`cluster_init_apm.sh`](./examples/cluster_init_apm.sh) script
instead of the [`cluster_init_infra.sh`](./examples/cluster_init_infra.sh)
script.

Additionally, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Databricks account and navigate to the desired
   [workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/concepts.html#accounts-and-workspaces).
1. Navigate to the [`Compute`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#view-compute)
   tab and select the desired all-purpose or job compute to open the compute
   details UI.
1. Click the button labeled `Edit` to [edit](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/clusters-manage.html#edit-a-compute)
   the compute's configuration.
1. Follow the steps to [configure custom Spark configuration properties](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#spark-configuration)
   and add the following lines after the last entry in the `Spark Config` field.

   ```
   spark.driver.extraJavaOptions -javaagent:/databricks/jars/newrelic-agent.jar
   spark.executor.extraJavaOptions -javaagent:/databricks/jars/newrelic-agent.jar -Dnewrelic.tempdir=/tmp
   ```

1. If your cluster is not running, click on the button labeled `Confirm` to
   save your changes. Then, restart the cluster. If your cluster is already
   running, click on the button labeled `Confirm and restart` to save your
   changes and restart the cluster.

#### Viewing your cluster data

With the New Relic Infrastructure Agent init script installed, a host entity
will show up for each node in the cluster.

With the New Relic APM Java Agent init script installed, an APM application
entity named `Databricks Driver` will show up for the Spark driver JVM and an
APM application entity named `Databricks Executor` will show up for the
executor JVMs. Note that all executor JVMs will report to a single APM
application entity. Metrics for a specific executor can be viewed on many pages
of the [APM UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/response-time-chart-types-apm-browser/)
by selecting the instance from the `Instances` menu located below the time range
selector. On the [JVM Metrics page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/features/jvms-page-java-view-app-server-metrics-jmx/),
the JVM metrics for a specific executor can be viewed by selecting an instance
from the `JVM instances` table.

Additionally, both the host entities and the APM entities are tagged with the
tags listed below to make it easy to filter down to the entities that make up
your cluster using the [entity filter bar](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities/)
that is available in many places in the UI.

* `databricksClusterId` - The ID of the Databricks cluster
* `databricksClusterName` - The name of the Databricks cluster
* `databricksIsDriverNode` - `true` if the entity is on the driver node,
   otherwise `false`
* `databricksIsJobCluster` - `true` if the entity is part of a [job cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/en/jobs/use-compute.html),
   otherwise `false`

Below is an example of using the `databricksClusterName` to filter down to the
host and APM entities for a single cluster using the [entity filter bar](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities/)
on the `All entities` view.
